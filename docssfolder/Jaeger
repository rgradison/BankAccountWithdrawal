Why Jaeger in Microservices?
Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system used in microservices architectures to track how requests flow through multiple services. It helps debug, optimize performance, and monitor transactions across distributed systems.

ðŸ”¹ Why Use Jaeger?
Observability Across Microservices

Microservices communicate over networks (HTTP, Kafka, gRPC, etc.), making debugging difficult.

Jaeger traces requests across services and visualizes the entire request path.

Performance Bottleneck Detection

Helps identify which service is slow or where latency occurs.

Error & Failure Diagnosis

Traces errors and exceptions across multiple services.

Root Cause Analysis

Tracks dependencies between services and pinpoints failures.

Distributed Context Propagation

Passes trace IDs across services for correlation.

Scalability & Efficiency

Designed for high-performance tracing without much overhead.

ðŸ”¹ How Jaeger Works?
Jaeger collects tracing data using Spans & Trace IDs.

Spans â€“ A single unit of work in a request (e.g., API call, DB query).

Trace â€“ A collection of spans forming a request's journey.

Context Propagation â€“ Passes the trace ID through services.

ðŸ”¹ Example Flow:

User Request â†’ API Gateway â†’ Service A â†’ Service B â†’ Database
Jaeger tracks this request end-to-end.

ðŸ”¹ Setting Up Jaeger with Spring Boot
Step 1: Add Dependencies
xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger</artifactId>
    <version>1.25.0</version>
</dependency>
Step 2: Configure Jaeger
yaml
Copy
Edit
management:
  tracing:
    sampling:
      probability: 1.0  # 100% tracing
  otlp:
    tracing:
      endpoint: http://localhost:14268/api/traces
Step 3: Run Jaeger Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
âœ… Access UI: http://localhost:16686

ðŸ”¹ Summary
âœ… Jaeger is essential for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing microservices.
âœ… Tracks complete request flows across multiple services.
âœ… Detects bottlenecks and errors easily.
âœ… Integrates with OpenTelemetry for scalable tracing.
