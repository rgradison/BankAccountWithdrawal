whats the dwfault cache in springboot?

ChatGPT said:
In Spring Boot, the default cache provider is ConcurrentHashMap-based caching, which is a simple in-memory cache implementation. This is used when you enable caching but don‚Äôt specify any caching provider.

How Does the Default Cache Work?
It stores cache data in memory using a ConcurrentHashMap, which provides thread-safe operations.

The cache is non-persistent (data is lost when the application restarts).

It is enabled automatically when you annotate methods with @Cacheable, @CachePut, or @CacheEvict.

How to Enable the Default Cache?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add the @EnableCaching annotation in your Spring Boot application:

import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@EnableCaching
public class CacheConfig {
}
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use @Cacheable in your service method:

import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Cacheable("products")
    public String getProductById(Long id) {
        System.out.println("Fetching product from DB...");
        return "Product " + id;
    }
}
Where Is the Cache Stored?
By default, Spring Boot uses SimpleCacheManager, which internally relies on ConcurrentHashMap. You can see this in action if you check:

@Bean
public CacheManager cacheManager() {
    return new SimpleCacheManager();
}
Limitations of the Default Cache
‚ùå No eviction policy ‚Äì Data stays in memory until the app restarts.
‚ùå Not suitable for distributed environments ‚Äì Since it's in-memory, it doesn't work well across multiple instances.
‚ùå Limited size ‚Äì All cached data is stored in RAM, which may cause memory issues.

Alternative Cache Providers (for better scalability)
Ehcache (in-memory caching with eviction policies)

Caffeine (high-performance caching)

Redis (for distributed caching)

Hazelcast (for distributed microservices caching)

Infinispan (advanced caching for large-scale apps)
