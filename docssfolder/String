can you draw the picture of the heap for me please.

        Heap
    Two components

1.String constant pool
    Hello
2.New string objects
    Outside string constant pool
        Hello

üõ† Key Takeaways
1.Stack Memory stores only references to String objects.
2.Heap Memory (String Pool) stores string literals (only one copy is kept).
3.Heap Memory (Outside Pool) stores new String() objects separately.
4.Comparing == checks references, not content.
    s1 == s2 is true (if both are in the String Pool).
    s1 == s3 is false (if s3 is a new String()).

So both string objects and string literals are stored in the heap? what about the stack?

ChatGPT said:
Yes! Both string objects and string literals are stored in the Heap, but with a slight difference:

String Literals ‚Üí Stored in the String Constant Pool (inside Heap)
String Objects (created with new) ‚Üí Stored in the Heap (outside the String Pool)
Stack Memory ‚Üí Stores only the references (variable names), NOT the actual string objects.

üìù Where Exactly is Everything Stored?
Memory Type	What is Stored Here?	Example
Stack (Method Stack)	Stores references (variable names) to string objects	String s1 = "Hello"; (Reference s1 is in Stack)
Heap (String Constant Pool)	Stores string literals to be reused	"Hello" (Only one copy exists in the pool)
Heap (Regular Heap Area)	Stores new String() objects outside the pool	new String("Hello") creates a new object each time

public class StringMemoryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Java";                // Stored in String Pool (Heap)
        String s2 = "Java";                // Same reference as s1 (String Pool)
        String s3 = new String("Java");    // Stored separately in Heap (outside Pool)

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // true (Both point to the same object in the String Pool)
        System.out.println(s1 == s3);  // false (s3 points to a different object in Heap)
    }
}


where is a string stored in memory, stack or string constant pool

Where is a String stored in memory?
In Java, String objects can be stored in different memory locations depending on how they are created. Let's break it down:

1Ô∏è‚É£ String Constant Pool (Heap)
‚úÖ Stored in Heap (Inside String Pool)
If a String is created using string literals, Java reuses it to save memory.

String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";
‚úÖ Both s1 and s2 point to the same object in the String Pool, not two separate objects.
‚úÖ The JVM interns the string (reuses it).

üìç Location: Heap (String Constant Pool)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Heap Memory (Outside String Pool)
If a String is created using the new keyword, it is stored outside the String Constant Pool.

String s3 = new String("Hello");
String s4 = new String("Hello");
üö® Each new String("Hello") creates a new object in Heap Memory
üö® s3 and s4 are different objects, even if they contain the same text.

üìç Location: Heap (but NOT in String Constant Pool)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stack Memory (References)
The references (variable names) for strings are stored in Stack Memory, but the actual string objects are in the Heap.

String s1 = "Hello";  // Reference in Stack, object in String Pool
String s2 = new String("Hello"); // Reference in Stack, object in Heap (outside pool)
üìç Location:

s1 and s2 are references stored in Stack Memory.
Their actual objects are stored in Heap Memory.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Example to Understand Memory Storage

public class StringMemoryTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Java";   // Stored in String Pool
        String s2 = "Java";   // Reused from String Pool
        String s3 = new String("Java"); // Stored in Heap outside String Pool

        System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (same reference in String Pool)
        System.out.println(s1 == s3); // false (different objects in Heap)
    }
}
‚úÖ Summary:

String Creation	Stored In	Reference Stored In
"Hello"	String Pool (Heap)	Stack
new String("Hello")	Heap (outside Pool)	Stack
String s1 = "Hello"; String s2 = "Hello";	Same object in Pool	Stack
String s3 = new String("Hello"); String s4 = new String("Hello");	Different objects in Heap	Stack
