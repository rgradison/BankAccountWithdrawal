1. Key Aspects of Abstraction in Java
a. Achieving Abstraction
In Java, abstraction can be implemented in two primary ways:

Abstract Classes (abstract keyword) → Supports partial abstraction (0-100%).
Interfaces (interface keyword) → Supports 100% abstraction in Java 8 and below (pre-default methods).
b. When to Use Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Method Implementation	Can have both abstract and concrete methods	Java 8+ allows default/static methods, but pre-Java 8 had only abstract methods
Fields/Variables	Can have instance variables	Only public static final constants
Inheritance	Supports single inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
Use Case	When you want a base class with shared functionality	When you want to enforce a contract across multiple unrelated classes
