🔹 What Does Serializable Do in Java?
Serializable is a marker interface in Java, found in java.io. It enables an object to be converted into a byte stream so it can be:

Saved to a file
Sent over a network
Stored in a database
Reconstructed later (deserialization)

🔹 When Should You Use Serializable?
✔ Use it when you need to store or transfer objects, such as:

Caching objects in Redis
Sending objects over Kafka or RabbitMQ
Saving objects in files or databases
Sending objects in a distributed system

🔹 Summary
Feature	Serializable
Type	Marker interface
Purpose	Enables object serialization & deserialization
Methods	❌ No methods
Requires serialVersionUID?	✅ Recommended
Skips Fields?	✅ Yes, using transient

📌 Final Verdict: Serializable is useful for object persistence and transmission, but modern systems often use JSON or Protocol Buffers instead. 🚀
